Sorting Stratagies:
	1.enumaration sorting
	2.exchange Sorting
	3.selection sorting
	4.insertion sorting
	5.divide and conqre

Sorting Algorithms:
	1.Bubble Sort: it comes under exchange sort and serches in the array linearly it checks a[n] with a[n-1] if the order is wrong
				   it rearranges the order and it repeats untill it gets sorted out the time complexity is O(n^2)
