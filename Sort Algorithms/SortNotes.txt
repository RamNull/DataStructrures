Sorting Stratagies:
	1.enumaration sorting
	2.exchange Sorting : if 2 items are out of order exchange them repeat all the items till its sorted 
	3.selection sorting : find the smallest item put it in the first position find the smallest item from the list and push it recursively
	4.insertion sorting : take the item and insert it into empty data structure such that data structure cuntinues to sort at each stage 
	5.divide and conqre : recursively split the problem in to smaller problem till you have trivial items to sort and then put togeter 

Sorting Algorithms:
	1.Bubble Sort: it comes under exchange sort and serches in the array linearly it checks a[n] with a[n-1] if the order is wrong
				   it rearranges the order and it repeats untill it gets sorted out the time complexity is O(n^2)
